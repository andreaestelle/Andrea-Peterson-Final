        <h1>Work Experience</h1>
        <h3>User Experience Design + Tech Support Intern</H3>
        <h4>A Mobile Maintenance</h4>
        My role was to support rapid growth in the company by redesigning the technology systems in place. The scope included
        <ul>
            <li>Meeting with 20 in-office and mobile employees to understand unique challenges related to their in-house management system</li>
            <li>Designing, testing, and implementing changes using Figma for their web and mobile system</li>
            <li>Meeting with developers weekly to resolve current issues as well as planning future developments</li>
            <li>Analyzing 5,000+ hours of call data and redesigning call flow to support changes in volume</li>
            <li>Researching and transitioning the VOIP system to improve communication and integrate with their management system</li>
            <li>Implementing company-wide cloud-based systems to reduce variability between shared computers and reduce the learning curve for new employees</li>
        </ul>

        <H3>Volunteer English Teacher</H3>
        <h4>International Language Program in Uganda</h4>
        Schools are taught in English but families speak mostly Luganda at home. Children who are unable to understand and communicate their schoolwork fail courses and leave school, furthering the poverty cycle. My volunteer work included
        <ul>
            <li>Creating and teaching lesson plans for 3-8 year-olds using objects to associate their senses with language, and encouraging speech through effort-based rewards</li>
            <li>Supporting personal needs of students such as fundraising school fees, providing shoes and clothing, and building relationships with their families and the surrounding community</li>
            <li>Fundraising for and building 3 spring wells to provide greater access to clean water</li>
            <li>Weekly volunteering with an overcrowded and underfunded local orphanage to nurture and teach 50 children</li>
        </ul>
